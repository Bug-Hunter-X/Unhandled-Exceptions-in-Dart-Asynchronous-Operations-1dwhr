# Unhandled Exceptions in Dart Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: improper handling of exceptions within asynchronous operations.  The `fetchData` function fetches data from a remote API.  While it includes a `try-catch` block, it's incomplete. The current implementation only prints errors to the console, providing limited debugging information and not handling all potential failures.  The improved solution addresses this by providing more robust error handling and informative error messages.
